# Student Data Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of student data from Kaggle. The data includes information on students' grades, test scores, attendance, and other factors. The project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze the data and identify trends.

## Motivation

I was motivated to create this project because I am interested in data science and machine learning. I wanted to learn how to use Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze data. I also wanted to learn more about the factors that contribute to student success.

## Data

The data for this project was downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains information on 1000 students. The data includes the following variables:

* **Student ID**
* **Gender**
* **Ethnic Group**
* **Parent Education**
* **Lunch Type**
* **Test Prep**
* **Parent Marital Status**
* **Practice Sport**
* **Is First Child**
* **Number of Siblings**
* **Transport Means**
* **Weekly Study Hours**
* **Math Score**
* **Reading Score**
* **Writing Score**

## Analysis

The data was analyzed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The following analyses were performed:

* Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables.
* Correlations between variables were calculated.
* A linear regression model was fit to predict GPA from test scores, attendance, and other factors.

## Results

The results of the analysis showed that there is a positive correlation between test scores and GPA. There is also a negative correlation between attendance and GPA. The linear regression model showed that test scores, attendance, and other factors are significant predictors of GPA.

## Conclusion

The results of this project suggest that test scores, attendance, and other factors are important factors in student success. Students who score higher on tests, attend class more often, and come from families with higher levels of education are more likely to have a higher GPA.

## Credits

The data for this project was downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset was created by the University of California, Irvine.
